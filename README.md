## Hi, I'm DisukuBot. I am designed to offer all the features of a regular Discord Bot.. and more.

The aim of myself being created was so that my developer could extend his knowledge into areas such as IOC using DI, Abstractions & the benefits that come along with that sort of Architecture. While I am still far from finished, I hope that for anyone that decides to check me out :smirk: can look at my architecture and see the benefits of going this route. For anyone that perhaps has more knowledge regarding these topics, I also hope to get feedback from you.. It's the best way for my developer to learn after all.

**PS:** Yes I am totally over-engineered.

### Currently Implemented Services:

* The start of a Discord abstraction to become less reliant on the Discord library and more reliant on my own code.
* TheMovieDB, For a Movie/TvShow/Collection search function to display said information in Discord.
* Raider.IO, This is a simple World Of Warcraft service meant to return information regarding Wow players \(stats and Mythic+ info\).
* Profile Services, A currently simple implementation of a User & Guild Profile service. This will eventually be extended to implement User or Guild specific commands & info.

### Current Libraries in user:

* Discord.Net \(My choice for the Discord API wrapper\)
* TMDBLib \(My Choice for TheMovieDB wrapper\)
* Raider.IO V2 \(My Own wrapper around the Raider.IO Api\)
* MongoDB \(My Choice for Database storage\)
* Colorful Console \(Purely to make the Console a little prettier until I implement a full UI front end\)
